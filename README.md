## Project Description

As someone who lives in New York City, apartments are always on my mind. Rent is pricey.

But how pricey is it? This curiosity as well as the desire to play around with some Python data science modules (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib) led me to this personal project.

In this project, I dove into the data and investigated following questions:

1. What do rental apartment prices look like from the pre-pandemic high to Sept. 2021?
2. What do rental apartment prices look like from the pre-pandemic high to the pandemic low?
3. What are currently the most expensive neighborhoods for a studio apartment in Manhattan and Brooklyn?
4. What have apartment prices looked like from Jan. 2012 to Sept. 2021?
5. What have apartment prices looked like from Jan. 2020 to Sept. 2021?

*Note: This analysis was conducted in Oct. 2021.*

The data for this project was extracted from a couple of csv files from StreetEasy, a real estate listing platform for the New York metropolitan area. Both csv files are attached to this repository and were imported into the Jupyter Notebook using the Python Pandasâ€™ function `read_csv()`.
